# Description

Dear .bashrc, although I can do without you, I still like to use you.

## Featuring

 - set `vim` to be your default editor
 - Aliases:
	- vagrant
	- terraform (just because two letters are less than nine)
	- special Ansible venv activation
	- git
	- cd (yes, even changing directories is too expensive)
	- alpha (just enumerated English alphabet)
	- Docker PSQL autostart (if found)
	- virtualenvwrapper

## Installation

You know how to do this. If you don't, you're either too old or too young.
